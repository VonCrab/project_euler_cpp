Euler problems solved in C++

I haven't used C++ since 2008 so lets see how this goes.

## How to run
Each program was compiled and tested using mingw-w64's g++ compiler: `g++ (x86_64-posix-seh-rev0, Built by MinGW-W64 project) 8.1.0`. This could lead to some erratic behavior on other compilers. I would like to get Microsoft C++ to test both different methods in the future.

Simply compile each `problem_number.cpp` file in the subdirectories then run the EXE.
